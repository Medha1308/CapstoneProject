Helpline portal using ServiceNow
The Project – I have created a HelpLine Portal, which helps to provide essential support to the employees during the time of the Covid-19 Pandemic. The portal provides a complete source of information and resources that employees might need during the time of this global crisis. I have included the following features in my portal :
1. Service Catalog - Allows the users to explore the catalog and order the available Resources. So, that they can borrow or order right away from the portal.
2. Knowledge base – Includes the articles containing information from authentic sources related to Covid.                                                             
3. Work Flows -  I have added two work flows here – One for the Catalog and another for the Incidents raised Record Producer. In the catalog workflow, I have designed the process, what goes behind after ordering from the catalog. In my case the request will automatically assigned to the SUPPORT GROUP I have created and then after approval, the fulfilment will take place.
Also, for the Incidents, the work flow will auto populate the Description (that I have defined in the workflow) and auto assign the ticket to the Covid 19 support group and member.
